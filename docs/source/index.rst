=================
What is MRAG?
=================
MRAG is a no-code platform to build RAG pipelines and chat with your documents which uses GenAI technology to answer your queries about your documents.


=================
Why use MRAG?
=================
Creating RAG pipelines to chat with your documents requires technical knowledge. MRAG enables users with minimal technical knowledge to build RAG pipelines with ease. 
MRAG has a drag-and-drop user interface that enables a user to build indexing pipelines without writing a single line of code. MRAG is loaded 
with multiple settings enabling a user to even handle complex documents.


=============================
Can MRAG handle every case?
=============================
No application can satisfy all the requirements of a user, same goes with MRAG as well. While, MRAG can help a user build RAG pipelines for simple and complex use cases, 
there might be situations where a user needs to build more complex RAG pipelines to satisfy their requirements.
